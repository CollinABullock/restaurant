# Restaurant App

Welcome to our full-stack restaurant application! This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js). It is designed as a demo project, mimicking the functionalities of a real-world restaurant website to help you explore and understand the intricacies of each technology within the stack.

## Introduction
